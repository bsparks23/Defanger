Defanger is a Python script that defangs IP addresses and domains based on regex patterns. The use of regex allows the script to parse entire texts and defang all IP addresses and domains. The script automatically searches for a .txt file named "input.txt" in the script's directory as the default input source which can be changed as needed. This script can serve as a component in safeguarding against security threats by sanitizing data that may contain potentially harmful IP addresses and domains.
